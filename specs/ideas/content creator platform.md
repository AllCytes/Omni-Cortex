Okay, so a couple of ideas that I have for the node-based editing platform for content creators is:
1. One idea is that we would use Open Router to be able to choose any model, the use of being able to use LLMs to create hooks.
2. Then you would have essentially a process where you can either bring in ideas (that's a node in itself), or you could bring in URLs, or viral videos, or any type of documentation (whether it's PDFs, PowerPoint, Excel sheets, Word documents, etc.) where it's like research stuff that you kind of want to talk about in the video.
3. You would have that as a node. You can have a little text box essentially that will allow you to add additional context or information on how you want that content to be parsed out or extracted, or whatever.
4. Then you would have that as its own node, and use a hook node to essentially generate well-thought-out hooks and expert-level hooks from each different platform (whether it's a YouTube video, an Instagram short, a TikTok video, LinkedIn, or whatever the case is).
5. Then you would choose what output you're looking for that would be another node. If you're looking for like a blog or creating a video or creating an image or anything like that, then you would have another node where you can create an image, and you can set up multiple nodes essentially so you can create multiple different images based on the different things.
6. You can also bring in like an avatar if you want to of a specific character or person that's going to be going through out that video or whatever.

As a content creator, you can rearrange the nodes however you want and create as many nodes as you want for that workflow. This gives you a templatized workflow.

Instead of having to go into each and every platform to first build out the script or do the research, there's even a research node that we would have in there. Then it would go about writing the script. You can go back and forth with it. Once you get a pretty good system, then you have that script and that's a node in it of itself that you can have.

You have the input information node where you essentially can pull in any sort of information. And then once you have that process, then you can just quickly rinse and repeat and bring in any information. And then it will just run through that workflow that you have.

As a content creator, maybe you don't have just one way of creating content, but you have multiple different ways. And so now you can create content very easily with this node-based system, creating multiple different templates on the fly, just putting in the information and it will run essentially the whole entire workflow once you have a good concrete workflow set. 

Also similar to the idea of the hook factory. That's what I mean by the hook node. It would generate hooks for any type of content.

And then also the idea that you had mentioned with the transcript intelligence, it would extract the transcript from multiple sources (whether that's videos, or anything like that, or shorts, or Instagram reels, or anything like that) and then it would analyze it (it would use Gemini vision model to be able to analyze the video that you are trying to replicate or get inspiration from). So it has a full understanding of it. 

I do want the workflow persistence to be able to save and load workflows, and then also import and export as JSON or anything like that. I do also want to templatize the workflows so for content creators that want to use that same process and a couple of other workflows that they end up creating, they can just go back to them quickly and be able to punch out content from that specific workflow. Maybe even have tabs so you can have multiple different workflows that you're running if you want to. So you don't have to be limited to just working on one workflow at a time. 

I like the idea of what you said on the new node types to add:
- Research nodes
- Script nodes
- Platform nodes
- Publishing nodes
I like all of those types of nodes. And I really like the competitor analysis node to be able to input a channel or account or anything like that and then it provides multiple things. I feel like maybe we can expand upon that, not just the top content. 

I also really like the Script Nodes, where it generates 10 different hook variations. Also, the B-Roll Suggester Node, the Script Writer or Script Re-writer Node, and the Call-to-Action Generator Node. 

All these nodes that you have recommended are amazing. These are great. And I do like the publishing nodes too, so like definitely a schedule node and then being able to post directly to the different other platforms and then also analytics node is amazing. We can probably expand upon that where we can track performance by maybe even just having to create another workflow where we can pull in that video that we published and it gives us multiple things to kind of look on on how well it did. It would scrape maybe the YouTube analytics from our dashboard or the YouTube studio that's ours. And then we can create a workflow that provides recommended ways to improve or anything like that. And then we can even put that straight into another workflow. It outputs essentially certain information, whatever we need, and then we just bring that into the new or the old work flow that we already created where we would bring in like the research nodes essentially if we already had like a workflow where we had the research nodes, the script nodes, and then the platform notes and then the publishing nodes all of those phases and we created a workflow on that. If we at the very end created a publishing analytics node at the very end of that work flow, maybe we even have like a loop node similar to like N8n where those analytics will then be brought back into the very beginning of the workflow and essentially recycle that content based on after we have analyzed the analytics from the first video. And if it does well, then we can quickly recycle that type of content and create content around the hooks that did well, or if it was the pain point that did well, or if it was the call to action that did well. Whatever analytics that performed really well, we just try to replicate that and then that gets fed back into the research nodes and then it... Creates new content. That's very similar.
